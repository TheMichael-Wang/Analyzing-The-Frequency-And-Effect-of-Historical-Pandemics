# HistoricalPandemicsData
This is a quick personal project where I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle about various pandemics throughout history, after which I plotted a graph showing the frequency
of outbreaks and made several observations based on the data.
The language used in this project was Python, where I first used the pandas library to import data from two csv files into a dataframe, after which I extracted the relevant data with some help from the regular expressions library, and finally used the pandas library again to plot a graph.
