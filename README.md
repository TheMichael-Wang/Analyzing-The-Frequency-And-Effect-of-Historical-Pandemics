# HistoricalPandemicsData
This is a quick personal project where I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle about various pandemics throughout history, after which I plotted a graph showing the frequency
of outbreaks and made several observations from the data.
The language used in this project was Python, with the libraries used being pandas and regex.
